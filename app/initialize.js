// Note: there's no longer any need to wait for DOMContentReady here as we
// now use jQuery.ready() in order to handle the DOM ready logic directly within
// index.html prior to attempting to load this 'initialize' CommonJS module.
// This means that you can count on the document being fully ready by the
// time this file (and all its dependencies) get loaded.

// Initialize/require your main JS module(s) here. For example:
// var concussion = require('js/concussions');

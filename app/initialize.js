// Note: there's no longer any need to wait for DOMContentReady here as we
// not use jQuery.ready() in order to handle this logic directly in index.html
// prior to attempting to load this 'initialize' CommonJS module.

// Initialize your main JS module here. For example:
// var concussion = require('js/concussions');
